    ### About The App:
    This app is being developed to help visualise historical data about air contaminants in Barcelona.  
    All maps are interactive. If you scroll on the map it will zoom in or out. To scroll the page, ensure that the cursor is in a white space at either side.

    ### About the Data:
    The data displayed in this application was obtained through the AMB Open Data [API](https://opendata.amb.cat/help.html), with available datasets spanning from 2019 through to November 2024.

    ### Contaminant Monitoring:
    At present, this app only contains data on the levels of $NO_2$, $O_3$, $PM_{10}$, and $SO_2$.
    Other contaminants are measured at some stations; however, their coverage across stations is minimal and therfore not included at the moment
